### MVP

CyclOps is a personal project that is important, necessary and long overdue.  The application provides road cyclist notification on approaching vehicle detection at a fixed distance. Its primary capability is on-device object detection using machine learning and a custom trained dataset having a high confidence score for a variety of vehicle shapes and size.   

The Alpha version is being used for rapid application prototyping to working out technical details and training model annotated data.  Therefore this repository CONTAINS speculative features and functionality
that may or may not be included in a production version.

### Machine Learning Dataset Training Status

- 20240906 Training data has not been included here as it's still in the training/annotation stage and not ready for a beta testing.<br />
  Once its close, it will likely be posted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) since that is where the initial dataset was pulled from.

### Project Updates

As features are tested and included in either an Alpha or Beta release version, the changes will be noted in that versions change log. To contribute to the project or volunteer to beta test pre-release version, please email <ronwhite562@gmail.com> with subject `contributor` or `beta tester`. This project is in active development and I will reply.

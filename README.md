# CyclOps Alpha

## MVP

The Alpha version is a rapid application prototype mainly for working out the technical 
and users components necessary to field test and development a Minimum Viable 
(or Most Valuable) Product.  This repo will contain speculative features and functionality
that may or may not be included in a production version.

## Machine Learning Field Training

Additionally, limited training data in the form of both images and video has been annotated 
for inclusion in a custom dataset. However, the current training is limited and requires a
more diverse corpus of source data. That data can only be captured in real world samples
with different weather, lighting and road conditions.
